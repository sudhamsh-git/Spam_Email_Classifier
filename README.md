## Project Overview

The Spam Email Classifier is built using machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. It employs NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and vectorization to preprocess and analyze email content. The primary goal is to classify emails into spam and non-spam categories.

## Features

- Multi-model classification approach
- NLP preprocessing with tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization
- Vectorization using TF-IDF and Count Vectorizer
- Evaluation with precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of model performance
